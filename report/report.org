* Instructions for Comiling and Running
Run =make=. Then there are two jar files: one for problem 1 and one for problem
2 (the bonus problem). The jar files are =p1.jar= and =p2.jar=, respectively.
The make targets =run-p1= and =run-p2= run the programs using the sample
=input.txt= file and save it in the an =output= directory.

* Dataset Results
The outputs from both programs are saved in the hdfs directories
=/user/mf-17s/p1-output= and =/user/mf-17s/p2-output=, respectively. The
histogram for the number of tweets per hour can be seen in Figure [[fig:p1]]. The histogram
for the number of sleep tweets per hour can be seen in Figure [[fig:p2]].
